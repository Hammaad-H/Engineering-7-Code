However, if we introduce the element of a \"floor\", and a model for \"bouncing\" and \"rolling\", then the picture becomes more complicated.

    "## Question 2.4 -- Loop through time\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now launch the for loop that will compute the trajectory of the ball through time. In the `k`'th iteration, the task is to compute values to write into the `k`'th position of our six arrays, based on the values in the `k-1`'th array positions. Next we'll outline this calculation in four steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **rolling update**. The ball is considered to be rolling at time `k` if its position at `k-1` was within one centimeter of the floor *and* its vertical speed at `k-1` was less than 0.01 m/s (in absolute value). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **velocity update**. The horizontal speed of the ball remains constant for all time. The ball's change in vertical speed depends on whether it is rolling or in flight. If it is rolling, then its vertical speed is zero. Otherwise (when it is in flight), its vertical speed is decreased by `dt*g` with respect to the previous time instant; i.e. `vy[k] = vy[k-1] - dt*g`. Here `g` is gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **position update**. We assume that `vx[k-1]` and `vy[k-1]` are the *average* velocity of the ball over the time interval from `time[k-1]` to `time[k]`. If so, then the ball will have advanced by `dt*vx[k-1]` in that interval, and hence `px[k] = px[k-1]+dt*vx[k-1]`. The same is true of the vertical position when the ball is in flight. When it is rolling, the vertical position is set to zero: `py[k]=0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **bounce detection**. A bounce occurs whenever all three of the following conditions are met:\n",
    "    1. The vertical velocity is less-or-equal than zero,\n",
    "    2. The vertical position is less-or-equal than zero,\n",
    "    3. The ball is not rolling.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a bounce is detected at time `k`, then the vertical velocity is flipped from negative to positive, and multiplied by an energy-dissipating factor of 0.3: `vy[k] = abs(0.3*vy[k])`; the vertical position is set to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "`bounced[k]` is `True` if a bounced ocurred at time `k`.\n"
